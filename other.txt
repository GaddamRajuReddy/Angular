Grunt and Gulp are task runners,
Task runners are basically used to automate tasks in a development process. Some of these tasks include compressing JS files, compiling Sass files, watching out for file changes, minifying files and auto-prefixing.
While Grunt makes use of temporary files, Gulp uses Node streams.

Gulp is able to perform several tasks at a time, while Grunt performs tasks one after another.
Gulp was created based on an asynchronous approach which gives an opportunity to process a lot of files independently. 

Grunt is almost twice as faster as Gulp.
 If you are really comfortable writing JS functions, then Gulp is advisable, but, if you will rather write task configurations, then Grunt will suffice.
