What is CORS?
Ans: CORS also known as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a process for accessing various web resources on different domains. 
With the help of CORS, web scripts can be integrated more openly with external content of the original domain. 
This further leads to better integration between web services.


What is Continuous Integration?
Ans: Continuous Integration is the process of using codes that are specially designed & automated for testing. 
This process helps the developers to easily deploy codes during the time of production.
Web developers use this process to integrate codes several times a day. 
These codes are checked automatically Continuous Integration helps in detecting errors quickly and locating them more easily.

 What is Multi-threading?
Ans: Multi-threading is a process of improving the performance of CPU. Generally, 
it is the ability of a program to get managed by more than one user at a time or manage multiple requests by the same user. 
Multi-threading is done by executing multiple processes that can be supported by the operating system.

1. create procedure that accepts 2 parameters and returns sum of parameters 
create proc addn(@a float, @b float)
as
begin
declare @sum varchar(4)
set @sum=cast((@a+@b) as VARCHAR)
print 'the sum of '+cast(@a as varchar) + ' and ' + cast(@b as varchar) + ' is ' + cast((@a+@b) as VARCHAR)
print @sum
END

2. query to display StudentName, subName and marks of class 10
Student - Stid, Stname, Details
Subject - Subid, Subname
Marks - Stid, Subid, mark

select stname,subname, marks from student s join marks m on s.stid=m.stid join subject sb on sb.subid = m.subid
where s.class = 10

3. even numbers display using LINQ
List LstACValues = new List { 1, 7, 2, 5, 10, 16 };
            var result = (from m in LstACValues
                          where m % 2 == 0
                          select m).ToList();
            foreach (var item in result)
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            Console.ReadLine();

print even numbers from 1 to 10 using LINQ 
Enumerable.Range(1, 10).Where(n => n%2 == 0).ToList().ForEach(Console.WriteLine);
