Q1: Query to retrive first/last/middle of charaters from table.

SELECT LEFT('DIVYAPIDIGE', 3) 	RESULT:DIV
SELECT RIGHT('DIVYAPIDIGE', 3)	RESULT:IGE
SELECT CHARINDEX('@', PIDIGEDIVYA@GMAIL.COM) RESULT: 12
SELECT SUBSTRING('PIDIGEDIVYA@GMAIL.COM', 13, 9) RESULT:GMAIL.COM

Q2: Query to retrive employee name "start or end" with specific letter from table.

SELECT EMPNAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EMPNAME LIKE 'S%'  --START WITH
SELECT EMPNAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EMPNAME LIKE '%S'  --END WITH

Q3: Query to find 2/3/5/nth highest salary in below different ways

USING MAX:

SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE SAL < (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP)

USING SUBQUERY:

SELECT TOP 1 SAL FROM (SELECT DISTINCT TOP 2/3/5/N SAL FROM EMP ORDER BY SAL DESC)
RESULT
ORDER BY SAL

USING CTE(COMMON TABLE EXPRESION):

WITH RESULT AS (SELECT SAL , DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SAL DESC) AS DENSERANK FROM EMP)
SELECT TOP 1 SAL FROM RESULT WHERE RESULT.SAL = 2/3/5/N

Note: Prepare mostly using CTE, where DENSE_RANK() will assign a rank(value) to each row in a table. if row has duplicate salary data, it will give common rank.
 
Q4: Query to delete duplicate rows in a table

WITH EMPLOYEECTE AS (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ID ORDER BY ID) AS ROWNUMBER FROM EMP)
DELETE FROM EMPLOYEECTE WHERE ROWNUMBER > 1

Note: Prepare mostly using CTE, where ROW_NUMBER() will assign a rank(value) to each row in a table. if row has duplicate data, it will give unique rank.

Q5: create procedure that accepts 2 parameters and returns sum of parameters  

create proc addn(@a float, @b float)
as
begin
declare @sum varchar(4)
set @sum=cast((@a+@b) as VARCHAR)
print 'the sum of '+cast(@a as varchar) + ' and ' + cast(@b as varchar) + ' is ' + cast((@a+@b) as VARCHAR)
print @sum
END

Q6: query to display StudentName, subName and marks of class 10

Student - Stid, Stname, Details
Subject - Subid, Subname
Marks - Stid, Subid, mark

select stname,subname, marks from student s join marks m on s.stid=m.stid join subject sb on sb.subid = m.subid
where s.class = 10

Q7: query to find employee with age between 20 and 30 , sal having 50k

SELECT NAME, SAL FROM EMP WHERE SAL > 50K AND AGE BETWEEN 20 AND 30
 

Q8: employees  more than 50 in each dept

SELECT NAME, DEPT, COUNT(*) FROM EMP 
GROUP BY DEPT
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50

Q9: Department with maximum employees

SELECT Top1 DEPTNAME FROM EMP 
JOIN DEPT 
ON EMP.DEPID=DEPT.ID
GROUP BY DEPTNAME
ORDERBY COUNT(*) DESC
